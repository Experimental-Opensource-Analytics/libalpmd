# libalpmd
## Experimental port of libalpm on D language.

## Important:
* Now all functionality is broken.
* Published in order to hear your opinion.

## **Reasons:**
 * For my maybe-pet project
 * Trying to realize system-side library using all DLang futures and Phobos standart library (maybe using otherside packages aka Derelict-libarchive).
 * Global refactoring, and, how result, improving code readability and (maybe) performance.
 * Avoiding using C language standart library
 * Improve error handling
 * Identify what is missing in Phobos for system programming
 * To get experince

**What is done:**

 * [x] Converting using **ctod**
 * [x] Compilation (In the process, I broke everything I could break.) 
 * [ ] Nothing else

## What is the stage of refactoring?

[In two words...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvlryWVlgds)

## In plans
* Stabilizing the API
* Try it on real tasks

## **What is working:**

* **Nothing**
* **Realy nothing**
* **Im not kidding**

## **FAQ**

* > Can i use it?

IF you can...
