# libalpmd
## Experimental port of libalpm on D language.

## **Reasons:**
 * For my maybe-pet project
 * Trying to realize system-side library using all DLang futures and Phobos standart library (maybe using otherside packages aka Derelict-libarchive).
 * Global refactoring, and, how result, improving code readability and (maybe) performance.
 * Avoiding using C language standart library
 * Improve error handling
 * Identify what is missing in Phobos for system programming
 * To get experince

**What is done:**

 * [x] Compilation
 * [ ] Nothing else

## In plans
* Try is on real tasks

## **What is working:**

* **Nothing**
* **Realy nothing**
* **Im not kidding**

## **FAQ**

* > Can i use it?

At that moment absolutly no.

* > What is the stage of refactoring?
